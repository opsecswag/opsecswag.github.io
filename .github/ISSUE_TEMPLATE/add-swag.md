Reminder, from [README](https://github.com/opsecswag/opsecswag.github.io/blob/master/README.md):

> The goal of OpsecSwag is to list apparel that is fun and stylish, but that is
not in-your-face Bitcoin swag. In other words: it should not be immediately
obvious that this is Bitcoin swag. Especially to nocoiners. But if you know, you
know.
>
> Rough rules:
> * Doesn't say "Bitcoin"
> * No Bitcoin logo*
>
> (* unless it's really small or something)
