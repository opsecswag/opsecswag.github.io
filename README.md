# OpsecSwag.com

The goal of OpsecSwag is to list apparel that is fun and stylish, but that is
not in-your-face Bitcoin swag. In other words: it should not be immediately
obvious that this is Bitcoin swag. Especially to nocoiners. But if you know, you
know.

Rough rules:
* Doesn't say "Bitcoin"
* No Bitcoin logo*

(* unless it's really small or something)
