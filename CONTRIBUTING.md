## Contributing to OpsecSwag.com

Hey, thanks for taking the time to contribute! You're awesome! ðŸŽ‰

The goal of [opsecswag.com](https://opsecswag.com)
is to list apparel that is fun and stylish, but that is
not in-your-face Bitcoin swag.

### Suggesting a change

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/opsecswag/opsecswag.github.io/issues/new/choose)

That's it. There is no step 2.

### Implementing a change

1. Clone the repository
2. Add an `.md` file for the item you want to add
3. Fill in name, image, category, link, price, etc.
4. Add the image file you specified in the `.md` file to the `/assets/images` folder
3. [Create a pull-request](https://github.com/opsecswag/opsecswag.github.io/pulls) (like [this one](https://github.com/opsecswag/opsecswag.github.io/pull/10/files))

It might help to have a look at existing items in the `/_collections/` folder.

Refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/opsecswag/opsecswag.github.io/blob/master/README.md) if you have troubles with getting up and running.
